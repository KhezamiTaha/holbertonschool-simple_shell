.TH SIMPLE_SHELL 1 "December 22, 2023" "Version 1.0" "Simple Shell Manual"

.SH NAME
simple_shell \- UNIX command line interpreter

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B simple_shell

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBsimple_shell\fR is a command line interpreter designed for simplicity and adherence to basic UNIX shell practices.

.PP
The shell reads commands from the user, executes them, and displays a prompt for the next command. The user can input a single word command, and each command line must end with a newline. After executing a command, the shell displays the prompt again.

.PP
This shell does not support advanced features such as semicolons, pipes, redirections, or multiple-word commands with arguments. It follows a minimalist approach to provide a straightforward and basic command line interface.

.PP
If an executable cannot be found, the shell prints an error message and displays the prompt again. Error handling is a crucial aspect, ensuring a user-friendly and reliable experience.

.PP
The shell handles the "end of file" condition (Ctrl+D) gracefully, allowing users to signal the termination of input.

.SH USAGE
.B simple_shell

.SH COMMAND LINE INTERACTION
The shell interacts with the user by displaying a prompt and waiting for a command. Each command should be a single word, and the shell executes it immediately.

.PP
Example usage:
.BR $ ./simple_shell
.BR simple_shell$ command
.BR simple_shell$ another_command

.SH ERROR HANDLING
If the entered command is not found, the shell prints an error message and prompts the user again.

.PP
Example error handling:
.BR simple_shell$ non_existent_command
.BR simple_shell: non_existent_command: command not found
.BR simple_shell$

.SH END OF FILE CONDITION
The shell handles the "end of file" condition gracefully, allowing users to terminate input with Ctrl+D.

.PP
Example end of file:
.BR simple_shell$ Ctrl+D
.BR simple_shell: EOF (Ctrl+D)

.SH EXIT STATUS
The exit status of the last command executed is available in the \fB$?\fR variable.

.SH FILES
.BR /bin/simple_shell
